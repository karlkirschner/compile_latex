This is a script that can be used to compile a latex document (e.g. filename.tex), ensuring that all cross references and citations are correctly displayed. The documents are compiled using pdflatex.

Usage: compile_latex.py filename (i.e. minus the .tex extension)

System Requirement: Python3 and pdflatex

Note: you can uncomment the last 'remove_files()' line to remove all of the Latex-generated files. What will be kept are
    the tex and created pdf files.
